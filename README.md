# Elf bot

A super-simple Discord bot that detects and deletes spam messages (aka other channels' invites).

If the user insists, the bot kicks it.

## Try it

Install packages:

`yarn install`

Set env `BOT_TOKEN`, run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Compile and run in production

Set env `BOT_TOKEN`, compile:

```bash
yarn build
```

And finally run:

```bash
yarn start
```
